This repository contains R code used to prepare and analyze datasets collected during EXCHANGE's first sampling campaign (EC1). The central datasets for this manuscript are oxygen and greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, and N2O). These data were collected during a series of laboratory incubation experiments led by Alex Izquierdo (PNNL SULI, Fall 2021), where soils and sediments were inundated with seawater for 24 hours (treatment) to calculate rates of oxygen consumption. In addition, both treatment and control (soils and sediments which were not inundated) samples were analyzed for greenhouse gases after 24 hours to determine the role of inundation on short-term greenhouse gas production/consumption.
